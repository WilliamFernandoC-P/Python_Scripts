This repository contains several Python scripts for use in bioinformatics tasks and projects, such as DNA/RNA sequence management.

* [Download_GenBank_Sequences.py](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/Python_Scripts/blob/main/Download_GenBank_Sequences.py) is a Python script that uses the Biopython library to fetch nucleotide sequences from the NCBI database (GenBank) using a list of accession numbers. For each accession number, the script retrieves the corresponding GenBank record, saves the sequence in FASTA format to a local file named after the accession number. This allows for the automated download and conversion of nucleotide sequences from GenBank to FASTA format.
