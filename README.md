This repository contains several Python scripts for use in bioinformatics tasks and projects, such as DNA/RNA sequence management.

* With the script [Download_GenBank_Sequences.py](https://github.com/WilliamFernandoC-P/Python_Scripts/blob/main/Download_GenBank_Sequences.py) you can download multiple GenBank sequences only by knowing the accession code.
